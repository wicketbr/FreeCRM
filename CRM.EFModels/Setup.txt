How I use the EF tools to build the EF models from my database design.
For all steps below using the Package Manager Console utility, make sure the EFModels project
is set as the Startup Project. The Package Manager Console can be opened by selecting
"Tools / NuGet Package Manager / Package Manager Console" from the Visual Studio menus.

1.  Use the Scaffold-DbContext to create or update the EFModels after making changes to the
    underlying database.

    Scaffold-DbContext "Data Source=(local);Initial Catalog=CRM;Persist Security Info=True;User ID=sa;Password=saPassword;MultipleActiveResultSets=True;TrustServerCertificate=True;" Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer -OutputDir "EFModels" -Context "EFDataModel" -UseDatabaseNames -Force -NoOnConfiguring





	****** STOP HERE ******

	Unless you are building a solution to deploy to customers where you will be coding your data migrations,
	do not continue with any further steps. Once you have created your initial database by running the app,
	go into the DataAccess.cs file and set _useMigrations to false.

	If you are going to be building coded migrations, the following steps are only used to build the migration
	class file. You still then have to manually modify the DataMigrations.DBTYPE.cs files in the DataAccess
	project to manually create the correct SQL statements for the supported database types.

	For most users, you will simply want to use a database-first design approach. Let the code build your initial
	database, then set _useMigrations to false. Any further changes you make to your database design
	will only require re-running the Scaffold-DbContext command above to update your EF models.





2.  Remove or comment out the following OnConfiguring override in the \EFModels\EFDataModel.cs file before deploying:

    protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)
    #warning To protect potentially sensitive information in your connection string, you should move it out of source code. You can avoid scaffolding the connection string by using the Name= syntax to read it from configuration - see https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2131148. For more guidance on storing connection strings, see http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=723263.
        => optionsBuilder.UseSqlServer("Data Source=(local);Initial Catalog=Data;Persist Security Info=True;User ID=sa;Password=saPassword;MultipleActiveResultSets=True;TrustServerCertificate=True;");





3.  Build migrations from the Package Manager after making changes to the EF models using the
    Scaffold-DbContext method above, or by manually modifying the models:
    
    First migration: 
        add-migration 001

    Second migration, etc;
        add-migration 002, etc.

    Generate SQL script:
        script-migration
            To generate a script for a given framework uncomment the OnConfiguring override in the
            EFDataModel.cs file for the framework you are using, and use the "script-migration" command
            from the Package Manager console.

            NOTE: Not all of the scripts that are generated will be perfect, but they will be close.
            EF Core does a pretty good job with generating the migration scripts for the various
            providers. However, the scripts created, which I store in the Migration Scripts\Framework
            folders, are a good starting point for what ends up in the DataAccess\DataMigrations.Framework.cs
            files. Help with the difference between various frameworks can be found at convert-in.com, such as:

4.  Modify the various DataMigrations.FRAMEWORKS.cs class files to add a migration based on the
    finalized SQL that you have tested against your provider.
